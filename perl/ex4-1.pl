# Exercise 4-1
# Write a subroutine, named total, which returns the total of a list of num‚Äê bers.
# Hint: the subroutine should not perform any I/O; it should simply process its parameters and
# return a value to its caller. Try it out in this sample program, which merely exercises
# the subroutine to see that it works. The first group of numbers should add up to 25.
